<h1>Tips for building your own website</h1>
<br>
<h2>Mockups: The most important first step is to get your mockups ready!
Personally I recommend Figma for getting a mockup made. You can plan out and draw what
each page of your website will look like. If you have a team working on the page, you will
each have a reference point to work with while coding. Note that mockups may change once you
get deeper into coding the website.</h2>

<h3>Coding Languages: I personally use HTML + CSS for the frontend, then I have used Javascript combined with SQL
for the backend. Some people like to use react. Ultimately it all comes down to what is easier to you
and what you are familiar with!</h3>
