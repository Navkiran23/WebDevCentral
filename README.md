# WebDevCentral
WebDevCentral is a webpage where users can go in order to get started on their webpage needs.

The webpage features a landing page which consists of information on what this webpage is about and how you can use it.

Users can then visit the color palette page which will randomly generate a color palette to help with UI/UX for the webpage.

There also is a font page which displays different fonts users can look at to decide which fonts they want for their website.

Not only that, users can go to the getting started page for advice on how to get started with your website.

By using WebDev, I hope users will be able to get an all in one guide to getting started with website creation!
